Applied Radiation and Isotopes 64 (2006) 979–988 A theoretical model for the production of Ac-225 for cancer therapy by photon-induced transmutation of Ra-226 G. Melvillea,/C3, Sau Fan Liub, B.J. Allena aCentre for Experimental Radiation Oncology, St. George Cancer Care Centre, Gray St. Kogarah, NSW, Australia bUniversity of NSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia Received 18 January 2006; received in revised form 1 May 2006; accepted 4 May 2006 Abstract Radium needles that were once implanted into tumours as a cancer treatment are now obsolete and constitute a radioactive waste problem, as their half-life is 1600 years. We are investigating the reduction of radium by transmutation on a small scale by bombarding Ra-226 with high-energy photons from a medical linear accelerator (linac) to produce Ra-225, which subsequently decays to Ac-225, which can be used as a generator to produce Bi-213 for use in ‘targeted alpha therapy’ for cancer. This paper examines the possibility of producing Ac-225 with a linac using an accurate theoretical model in which the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum at 18 MV linac electron energy is convoluted with the corresponding photonuclear cross sections of Ra-226. The total integrated yield can then be obtained and is compared with a computer simulation. This study shows that at 18 MV, the photonuclear reaction on Ra-226 can produce low activities of Ac-225 with a linac. However, a high power linac with high current, pulse length and frequency is needed to produce practical amounts of Ac-225 and a useful reduction of Ra-226. r2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Actinium-225 Ac-225 is an alpha emitting radiosiotope with a 10-day half-life that decays to produce Bi-213. Either Ac-225 orBi-213 can be used as an agent for radio-immunotherapy. Alpha particle emitters are the most potent sources for lethal irradiation of single cancer cells and micrometastasesbecause of their densely ionising radiation. Alpha particlesare of considerable interest for radio-immunotherapy applications since their short range in soft tissue is limited to only a few cell diameters. Alpha particles have high linear energy transfer (LET) in tissues. High LET radiation induces far more biologicaldamage over a shorter range than low LET beta radiation,and is therefore much more cytotoxic. The delivery of such a high energy in so small a volume makes alpha particlesespecially well suited for targeting micrometastatic disease and single cancer cells such as leukaemia and other blood- borne disease. The Bi-213 radioisotope is of special interest because of its unique nuclear properties, which include a short 46-minhalf-life and high-energy (8.4 MeV) alpha-particle emis-sion. Its availability from the Ac-225/Bi-213 ( Actinium Pharmaceuticals, 2005 ) generator system makes this radio- isotope particularly well suited for medical use. Cancer trials are being conducted at the Cancer Care Centre, St. George Hospital in Sydney, where the TargetedAlpha Therapy (TAT) ( Allen et al., 2004 ) programme using Bi-213 offers the potential to inhibit the growth ofmicrometastases by selectively killing isolated and pre-angiogenic clusters of cancer cells. In TAT, the radio-isotope is bound to a monoclonal antibody or protein andtheir molecular subunits attach to the receptors on cancerARTICLE IN PRESS www.elsevier.com/locate/apradiso 0969-8043/$ - see front matter r2006 Elsevier Ltd.

cells, allowing radiation to attack the cancer while minimising the potentially negative impact to surroundingtissue. 1.2. Uranium-233 decay chain The Bi-213 isotope that is holding promise for cancer treatment is produced through a complex process that starts with U-233 ( Fig. 1 ). The key intermediates in this process are Th-229 and Ac-225. Ac-225 is currently derivedfrom puriﬁed Th-229 extracted from U-233 at ORNL ( Boll et al., 2005 ). There are a number of ways to produce Ac-225. The most practical way at present is to derive these isotopesfrom the decay of Th-229, which is produced by the decayof U-233. Ac-225 is the product being shipped to medical facilities. Bi-213 is separated from the Ac-225 at the hospital and combined with the targeting agent. 1.3. Production method Ac-225 could be produced using accelerators or reactors or by separation techniques. Methods include producingTh-229 directly as opposed to obtaining it by the decay ofU-233; producing Ra-225, which decays into Ac-225; andproducing Ac-225 directly. While each of these methodseventually results in a supply of Ac-225 for use in a Bi-213generator, they all require additional chemical processingand/or separation steps that are yet to be determined and will likely increase production costs.Possible ways of producing Ac-225 ( Koch et al., 1999 ) are: /C15232Th (n;g,2b)233U: This method involves bombarding Th-232 with thermal neutrons to produce U- 233, which will then follow the U-233 decay chain leading to Ac-225 as shown in Fig. 1 . /C15226Ra (3 n;2b)229Th: This method involves bombarding radium with thermal neutrons to produce Th-229 after 3neutron capture events, which decays to Ac-225. /C15226Ra ( p;2n)225Ac: In this method protons from a cyclotron produce Ac-225 directly with the peak crosssection being about 540 mb at 16 MeV proton energy. (Private communication: G Dracoulis, Australian Na- tional University) using the standard fusion-evaporationcode.) The 226Ra (p;3n)224Ac reaction rapidly takes over at higher energies. /C15226Ra ( n;2n,b)225Ac: Neutrons bombard radium to produce Ac-225. /C15226Ra (g;n)225Ra: This reaction produces Ra-225, which subsequently decays to Ac-225 through beta decays. A number of the above reactions involve neutron bombardment at thermal energies. For industrial applications that require neutrons, users have three primary sources fromwhich to choose: nuclear rea ctors, radioisotopes, and accelerator-based high-energy neutron sources. Nuclearreactors are the largest and most proliﬁc sources of neutrons. This paper investigates the photonuclear reaction route as medical linacs are routinely used for radiotherapy inhospitals. 1.4. Photonuclear production Linacs are the mainstay of radiotherapy treatment. They deliver megavoltage electron beams accelerated by klystron or magnetron generated radio-frequency ﬁelds throughcopper waveguides ( Dowsett et al., 2001 ). The beam of electrons from the gridded electron gun is focused by asolenoid to a beam of less than 2 mm in diameter to strike a0.76 mm thick tantalum or tungsten target and producebremsstrahlung radiation. Although the theoretical model in this paper is based on a 2100C MV Clinac from Varian, it would be very similar to any linac once the energy range was adjusted. Thespectrum of bremsstrahlung photons produced by the linacextends from zero energy up to the maximum energy of theelectrons hitting the target, which is 18 MeV in this case.Measuring or calculating the bremsstrahlung spectrum isvery difﬁcult. The most common approach today is to useMonte Carlo methods ( Ahnesjo, 1989 ) for calculating the spectra. The photonuclear reaction is 226 88RaþY!225 88Raþ1 0n. (1) Reaction (1) involves exciting the radium nucleus with bremsstrahlung photons so that a neutron is ejected. TheARTICLE IN PRESS Fig. 1. U-233 decay chain ( Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, 2005).G. Melville et al. / Applied Radiation and Isotopes 64 (2006) 979–988 980
reaction threshold of 6.4 MeV is easily achievable with a linac. The reaction is electromagnetic in nature and wouldbe virtually instantaneous. This means after irradiation,Ra-225 will be at a maximum yield and will decay slowly over time, the half-life being 14.9 days, producing Ac-225 by beta emission, by the following decay: 225 88Ra!225 89Acþ0 /C01e. (2) 2. Theory 2.1. Bremsstrahlung production An electrically heated ﬁlament (cathode) within the linac generates electrons that are accelerated by waveguide from the ﬁlament to the tungsten target by the application ofhigh-voltage pulses applied between drift tubes. Onceinside the drift tube, they are shielded from the ﬁeld anddrift through at a constant velocity. When they arrive atthe next gap, the radiofrequency ﬁeld accelerates themagain until they reach the next drift tube. This continues,with the particles picking up more and more energy in each gap, until they exit onto the target. The drift tubes are necessary because an alternating ﬁeld is used and withoutthem, the ﬁeld would alternately accelerate and deceleratethe particles. The drift tubes shield the particles for thelength of time that the ﬁeld would be decelerating. Linac photons or bremsstrahlung radiation ( Bueche, 1969) arise when high-energy electrons penetrate the anode material passing close to its atomic nuclei. The electrons are deﬂected from their initial path by the nuclear coulomb ﬁeld of the tungsten atoms causing changes in velocity.Energy is lost in the form of electromagnetic radiation, which is called ‘braking radiation’ or bremsstrahlung. Energy transformations that yield the photon radiation vary since the bombarding electrons approach the nuclei at different impact radii. There is consequently a spread of bremsstrahlung energies from a maximum (where the entirekinetic energy is transformed into photon radiation) to thelowest energy photon emission when the electron is onlyslightly deﬂected by the nuclear ﬁeld. A polar diagram ( Nordell et al., 1984 ) showing the variation of the intensity of bremsstrahlung rays with angleproduced by the electron bombardment of various targets is shown in Fig. 2 . Curve A, shows 34 keV electrons bombarding a thin aluminium foil and curves B and C, 10and 20 MeV electrons bombarding a thin 0.05 cm tungstentarget. Curve D is a typical intensity distribution for adiagnostic X-ray tube with a 16 1thick tungsten target, with the beam taken at right angles to the electron beam andexcited at 90 kV p. As the energy of the bombarding electrons is increased, the two lobes of curve A, tip forward to yield, at very high energies, a distribution with all the radiation in the forward direction. Mohan et al. (1985) found that the angular distribution of 15 MeV photons from a Clinac-20 was very narrow withmore than 99.9% of all the photons contained within 2degrees of the central axis of the target. A 2100C Clinacwill have a similar photon angle distribution. This means at100 cm (SSD) the vast majority of the photon beam will be contained in an area with a cross section of less than 7 cm. This, of course, assumes there is no interference with thephotons on their journey. In reality, however, photonspread due to the linac collimator and ﬂattening ﬁlterwould need to be considered.ARTICLE IN PRESS Fig. 2. Bremsstrahlung emission from an accelerated charge.G. Melville et al. / Applied Radiation and Isotopes 64 (2006) 979–988 981
This study is based on an 18 MV 2100C Clinac. As such the range in photon energies (bremsstrahlung) is apositively skewed Gaussian curve with an average energyof about 6 MeV and peak ﬂux at 1.25 MeV. The photon intensity is high at low energies but quickly tapers off at higher energies. More will be said about this later. The most accurate way to calculate the yield ( Y)o fR a - 225 produced by the photonuclear reaction (1) is bysumming up the individual yields Y(E) over all brems- strahlung energies: Y¼Z E2 E1YðEÞdE, (3) where E1is the reaction threshold at 6.4 MeV ( Centre for Photonuclear Experiments Data (CDFE), 2005 )a n d E2is the maximum electron energy of the linac, i.e. 18 MeV. To perform this integration, the number of bremsstrah- lung photons and photon reaction cross section as a function of energy must ﬁrst be calculated over thebremsstrahlung energy range. 2.2. Reaction cross section The reaction cross section ( Wehr and Richards, 1974 )i s deﬁned by s¼NR N1, (4) where sis the cross section (barns), the NIthe number of incident particles per unit time (s) per unit area (cm2), and NRthe number of reactions per unit time (s) per nucleus. The cross section is a function of energy and can be evaluated at various energies using the cross section for thephotonuclear reaction given by the expression below, Eq.(5), which is an application of the Breit–Wigner formula(Allyn and Bacon, 1966 ). This formula describes the cross section for the formation of a particle resonance, inter- mediate between two other particle states: sðEÞ¼ ðG=2Þ2 ðE/C0ErÞ2þðG=2Þ2E Er/C18/C19 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ E/C0Et Er/C0Etsrr , (5) where is the Er¼13.45 MeV (giant dipole resonance (GDR) energy) ( Berman, 1976 ),Etthe 6.4 MeV (reaction threshold energy) ( CDFE, 2005 ),Gthe 3.97 MeV (FWHM at resonance) ( Berman, 1976 ), and sthe 521 mb ¼52.1/C2 10/C026cm2(peak resonance cross section) ( Berman, 1976 ): /C15The resonance energy ( Er) and peak resonance cross section ( s) values are unknown for Ra-226 but are assumed to be similar to other nuclides with similarmass number. The values used here are for Bi-209,which is one of the closest radionuclides with known values, which are comparable to Th-232. /C15The reaction threshold energy ( Et) has been calculated using the mass formula ( CDFE, 2005 ). /C15The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) at resonance (G) is unknown for Ra-226 but is assumed to be similarto nuclides with similar mass number. The value used here is for Bi-209. /C15The square root expression in the above cross sectionequation is the normalisation factor. It will be equal to one at resonance, less than one below resonance and greater than one above resonance. /C15The above equation is only accurate up to 18 MeVwhere single neutron reactions greatly dominate (validfor linac energies). At higher energies ( CDFE, 2005 ) two neutrons are produced. Because of the weak high-energytail of the photon spectrum (see later) these should notaffect the model calculation to any signiﬁcant degree. 2.3. Convolution The total yield ( Y) of Ra-225 is calculated using Eq. (6): Y¼Z 18 MeV 6:4M e VYðEÞdE¼Z18 MeV 6:4M e VNfðEÞsðEÞtdE, (6) where Yis the yield in Ra-225 atoms/s, Nthe number of atoms of Ra-226/cm3,fthe photon ﬂux/s, sthe cross section (mb), and tthe thickness of the Ra-226 target (cm): Yðatoms =sÞ¼Z18 MeV 6:4M e VðNatoms =cm3 /C2fphotons =s/C2tcmÞdE. ð7Þ 2.4. Transient equilibrium Once Ra-225 has been produced it will decay to Ac-225, as shown previously in Fig. 1 . The ideal theoretical case is shown in Fig. 3 , where the half-life of the daughter radionuclide is shorter than the parent radionuclide,resulting in transient equilibrium. This passing matchingARTICLE IN PRESS Fig. 3. Theoretical transient equilibrium resulting from the buildup of the shorter-lived Ac-225 activity beginning with a pure sample of the longer- lived parent Ra-225 nucleus.G. Melville et al. / Applied Radiation and Isotopes 64 (2006) 979–988 982
of activity occurs after about 13 days and the activity of the daughter at this point is about half that of the originalparent activity. However, in our situation, the curve onlyapproximates the theoretical since the Ac-225 (daughter) half-life (10 days) is not much shorter than the Ra-225 (parent) half-life (14.8 days). 3. Calculations 3.1. Linac parameters The relevant speciﬁcations of the 18 MV linac (provided by Varian Australia) are listed below ( Table 1 ). Linacs do not produce continuous current because pulsed electron beams are accelerated by klystron or magnetron generated radio-frequency ﬁelds through cop- per waveguides. This means the actual current-on time isbetween 3.5 and 4 mS, 180 times/s. Thus, the maximum pulse current of 36 mA is equivalent to an average beamcurrent of 26 mA, using a pulse length of 4 mS. As 1 amp ¼1 Coulomb/s ¼6.25/C210 18electrons/s, then 26mA¼1.625/C21014electrons/s. 3.2. Bremsstrahlung production efﬁciency The probability, p, for bremsstrahlung photons is about 1–5%/electron ( Dowsett et al., 2001 ) at low energies but increases with both atomic number Zof the anode material (target) and the electron beam energy Eb. Most of the electron energy (99%) is lost as heat. Above a certainenergy, called the critical energy ( E c), bremsstrahlung efﬁciency must be considered. This critical energy can becalculated ( Frauenfelder and Henley, 1991 ): E cE600/ZMeV¼8.1 MeV, which is well below the 18 MV energy in this study. The efﬁciency Zof bremsstrahlung production at electron energy ( Eb, eV) at low energies ( Dimitar, 1998 ) can be calculated from Z¼kEbZ, (8) where kis a constant, which depends on the material, and equals 1.1 /C210/C09for the tungsten target ( Z¼74) (Dowsett et al., 2001 ). The bremsstrahlung yield at low energies increases linearly as the energy of the incident electrons increases(Frauenfelder and Henley, 1991 ), but is generally less than5% at low electron energies (125 kV /C241%). At 1 MeV the yield can be as high as 8% ( Dowsett et al., 2001 ). No expression will give the bremsstrahlung efﬁciency exactly over the entire energy range. At medium energies the general approximation formula ( Emilio, 1975 ): Z/C25EbZ 750where Ebis the electron energy in MeV : (9) This is similar to Eq. (8) but increases to over 100% at energies around 12 MeV. To ﬁnd the bremsstrahlungelectron efﬁciency at 18 MeV three methods have beenexamined: /C15Use of a higher-energy approximation formula ( Meyer- hof, 1967 ): Z/C256/C210/C04ZEb 1þ6/C210/C04ZEbwhere Ebis in MeV : (10) This formula ensures the efﬁciency stays below 100% and gives 44.4% efﬁciency at 18 MeV. /C15Use of measured bremsstrahlung efﬁciencies in water (line of best ﬁt) Fig. 4 (Emilio, 1975 ). The efﬁciency of bremsstrahlung in elements of differentatomic number Zvaries nearly as Z 2(Meyerhof, 1967 ). Thus, the efﬁciency for tungsten is about 49% at18 MeV. /C15Table 2 (Spring, 1960 ) below, gives a small number of measured and theoretical values for tungsten. It shows that roughly a doubling in energy results in an almostdoubling in efﬁciency. This gives an extrapolatedefﬁciency at 18 MeV of about 52%. The higher-energy approximation formula (1st method) is the most accurate in determining bremsstrahlungefﬁciency as the other two methods, which rely on comparison with water and Z 2related bremsstrahlung increases, and are not accurate across the wide energyrange. This model uses a conservative 40% bremsstrahlung efﬁciency to normalise the photon spectrum in Fig. 5 . This means the total number of photons produced by the linacfrom 0 to 18 MeV is equal to 6.5 /C210 13. 3.3. Linac photon spectrum A photon spectrum can now be constructed knowing the total number of photons and their intensities. Thespectrum in Fig. 5 gives the number of photons as a function of photon energy up to 18 MeV using photonintensity data from Varian Corporation, and allows the calculation of the Ra-225 yield at each of these energies using the reaction cross section at these energies. With the photoneutron Eq. (1) having a threshold energy of 6.4 MeV, the total number of photons that couldproduce Ra-225 is 1.61 /C210 13.ARTICLE IN PRESS Table 1 Parameters of the 18 MV Varian Clinac 2100C Electron energy (max) ¼18 MeV (+3%) Peak pulse current /C2436 mA Frequency ¼180 Hz Pulse length ¼3.5m24mS Mean current ¼26mAG.

3.4. Calculated reaction cross section The photoneutron reaction (Eq. (1)) cross section over the range of linac energies can be calculated using expression (5) and is shown in Fig. 6 below. This graph shows a zero cross section at threshold reaction-energy of 6.4 MeV followed by a steady increaseup to a maximum cross section of 532 mb at an energy of13.75 MeV. The cross section is truncated at 18 MeV,which is the highest electron and photon energy of the linacin this model. 3.5. Yield of Ra-225 The total yield ( Y) of Ra-225 can now be calculated using Eq. (7) and the data that was used to construct bothFigs. 5 and 6 . The result of this calculation is shown in Fig. 7 , which is the yield in atoms of Ra-225/s over the complete energy range that the reaction can occur, i.e. from6.4 to 18 MeV. Maximum yield occurs at 13.5 MeV. A1 c m 3volume of Ra-226 contains 1.33 /C21022atoms, since 226 g of Ra-226 contains 6.023 /C21023atoms and Ra- 226 has a density of 5 g/cm3. Using Eq. (7), the total yield (Y)¼2.8/C21010atoms/s of Ra-225. Thus, an 18 MV linac bombarding a 1 cm3target of Ra-226 (with activity 5 Ci) with bremsstrahlung photons in the energy range from 6.4to 18 MeV, will produce 2.8 /C21010atoms of Ra-225/s or about 1014atoms/h of irradiation. This is based on a 40% bremsstrahlung efﬁciency, which is by far the main sourceof uncertainty in this simulation. This will be discussedlater. The activity of Ra-225 is given by A 225¼l/C2N225(no of atoms of Ra-225). The decay constant ( l¼0.693/ t1/2)o f Ra-225 (half-life: 14.9 days) is l¼5.38/C210/C07s/C01and 1 Ci¼3.7/C21010dis/s. Thus, A225¼5:38/C210/C07/C21014 ¼5:38/C2107Bqðdis=sÞ=h irradiation ¼1:45 mCi =h irradiation : 3.6. Optimum linac energy Computer simulation programs using C++ and MA- TLAB were also used to calculate the theoretical yield ofRa-225 using known Th-232 cross section data ( Berman, 1976) and combining it with bremsstrahlung photon spectra. The programme was designed so that it could beused for different energies and currents. MATLAB wasparticularly useful for plotting the graphs. The results are shown in Fig. 8 andTable 3 . One mole of Ra-226 was irradiated in this simulation. Calculations showed that the linac does not require the highest possible energy, as the yield plateaus with increas-ing energy. Therefore, the optimal energy for Ac-225 isaround 16 MeV. 18 MeV (Siemens) actually provides15.25 MeV, which is the nearest energy to 16 MeV. Onthe other hand, 10 MeV (Varian) is not much greater than the threshold energy of photoneutron reaction. 25 MeV (Elekta) provides the highest energy, however, the yield ismuch less than 15 MeV (Varian) because of lowerbremsstrahlung output. The reason for this is that,although linac power is the product of current and voltage,ARTICLE IN PRESS Table 2 Theoretical and measured bremsstrahlung efﬁciencies for tungsten Energy (MeV) Efﬁciency (%) Experimental Theoretical 0.90 3.4 3.4 1.63 5.8 5.62.35 10.4 8.305101520253035 0.010.0250.050.11 4 710 18 30 50 70100 Energy (MeV)Efficiency (%)) 18 MeV ~  7% Fig. 4.

and the voltage determines the electron energy, the electron energy and current is inversely proportional so both cannot increase together at a given power. 4. Discussion The total yield has been calculated by summing the individual yields over the energy range 6.4 MeV 218 MeV, so the calculation is quite precise since average values havenot been used. This model has been based on the linac operating at maximum current with a pulse length of 4 ms. In reality, the linac will pulse at between 3.5 and 4 ms, which could further reduce the yield by up to 12.5%. The important assumption here is that the Ra-226 interacts with all the photons in the beam. Thus, thepositioning of the radium source is very important. A calculation of photon ﬂux can now be done in terms of photons/cm 2/s interacting with Ra atoms/cm2as seen in Fig. 9 . This calculation assumes: /C15The radium needles are placed at a distance of 49.2 cmfrom the tungsten target./C15Angular distribution of photons is 4 1in total (see Mohan et al. (1985) ). /C15Photon ﬂux is evenly distributed within the beam width. A total photon count of 6.5 /C21013in an area of 9.3 cm2 through a distance of 49.2 cm gives a photon ﬂux of 7/C21012photons/cm2/s. However, considering the number of photons above the threshold energy that can actuallycause the desired photonuclear reaction, the above photonﬂux reduces to 1.7 /C210 12photons/cm2/s. The low yield results from the low current combined with the low pulse width and frequency. In order toincrease the yield so that worthwhile amounts of Ra-225and daughter radionuclides could be produced, a number of factors need to be considered. These are: /C15increase the maximum current, /C15increase the pulse length, /C15increase the pulse frequency, /C15increase irradiation time, /C15irradiate larger amounts of radium. A high-energy linac is needed to reach the GDR to maximise yield. Irradiation time can be increased by afactor of 10 (1–10 h) or more without too much strain onthe linac. Packing as much Ra-226 as possible into thetarget area is very important especially considering that1c m 3of Ra-226 is 5 g. Other factors such as using an efﬁcient method of separating the Ra-225/Ac-225 from Ra- 226 are important when considering the small yield. One way of obtaining reasonable amounts of Ra-226 is to use radium needles, which were once used to treatcancer. The treatment process involved encapsulatingradium in stainless steel needles, which were then imbeddedinto a tumour. The use of radium for cancer therapy wasphased out with the development of cobalt and caesiumsources, and with linacs being introduced for radiotherapy. It is estimated there are between 50,000 and 100,000 radium sources ( Vicente and Sordi, 2004 ) worldwide that still need to be processed. The Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) in Australia is known to possess aconsiderable store of old discarded radium needles. ThereARTICLE IN PRESS Fig. 8.

is also a store of radium needles at some hospitals. These needles are cylindrical in shape and are approximately1.5 cm long and have a diameter of about 0.25 cm. Theycontain about 20 mg (20 mCi) of very pure Ra-226. Irradiating one of these needles for an hour using the model in this paper will produce about 6 mCi of Ra-225 because of the small mass of the radium in each needle(20 mg). The cross section of the Ra-226 target for the photo- nuclear reaction determined by its GDR. This type ofresonance is due to the mode of nuclear vibration in whichat any instant the protons and neutrons collectively oscillate in opposite directions, with the centre of gravity remaining constant. The resonance decays by the emissionof one or more nucleons of which at least one is normally aneutron in the region of interest. The GDR leads to abroad peak (energy vs. cross section) and occurs in nucleithroughout the periodic table ( Williams, 1991 ). Linacs have a ﬂattening ﬁlter between the tungsten target and the irradiated source; its purpose is to give a more uniform radial ﬁeld. As expected, the ﬁlter absorbs some lower energy photons and thus leads to higher averagebeam energy. Since the threshold reaction to produce Ra-225 is 6.4 MeV, it makes little difference practically whetherthe ﬁlter is removed or not. The activity of the Ac-225 depends on the photon ﬂux, irradiation time, the activity of Ra-225, and half-life. TheAc-225 production rate: A 2¼NHA 1ðT1=ðT1/C0T2ÞÞð1/C0e/C00:693ðT1/C0T2Þt=T1T2Þ, where Nis the number of atoms Hthe irradiation time, and tthe time. Here, A1,A2are the activities and T1,T2are the half-lives of the Ra-225 and the Ac-225, respectively. A1is the product of photon ﬂux and cross section of Ra-226. The dependence of the two radionuclides is seen in Fig. 10 . The C++ computer simulation produced thisgraph for a 15 MeV Varian (maximum energy: 15 MeV) where a small amount of Ra-226 was irradiated in thesimulation. It shows that transient equilibrium occurs after18 days and compares favourably with the ideal theoretical result (assumes ideal situation where parent radionuclide half-life was a lot longer than daughter radionuclide half-life) in Fig. 3 where transient equilibrium was reached in about 13 days. The C++ computer simulation programme predicts that using an 18 MeV Varian to irradiate 1 cm 3of Ra-226 (5 g) for 1 h will give a yield of Ra-225 of 1.25 mCiassuming a consistent 40% bremsstrahlung efﬁciency, with the maximum yield of Ac-225 being 0.554 mCi and occurs after 430 h or 18 days. These C++ yield results are very consistent with the other results in this theoretical paper where 1.45 mCi/h ofRa-225 was produced (p. 13) under the same conditions. Asmentioned previously, the C++ results were constructedusing Th-232 cross section data and differ by only 16%from that where Bi-209 data was used. By far the greatest source of error in these simulations would be in the actual bremsstrahlung efﬁciency. Although Ra-226 and Th-232are deformed nuclei, using spherical cross section datafrom Bi-209 has not signiﬁcantly (less than 20%) alteredthe result at linac energies. 5. Conclusion On the basis of this theoretical approach, very low activities ( mCi) of Ra-225 can be produced by a common high-energy linac. The two different simulations gaveconsistent results when using cross sections data fromtwo different nuclei. An 18 MV linac irradiating 5 g of Ra-226 for one hour will produce between 1 and 2 mCi of Ra- 225. The simulation also shows that simply increasing linac energy beyond a certain level does not increase the yieldARTICLE IN PRESS Fig. 10. The photoneutron product (Ra-225) is at a maximum after irradiation using a Varian (15 MeV) and slowly decays while the decay product (Ac-225) builds to a maximum in 430 h before it slowly decays.G.

unless there is an increase in overall linac power. Although the photonuclear reaction is inefﬁcient, the yield can begreatly increased by using a longer irradiation time, placingthe radium target in a prime position and having a high mass Ra-226 target. Stacking together a large number of radium needles may do this. Furthermore, considering that after the valuable Ac-225 is extracted from the target the residual Ra-226 can againbe irradiated in a continuing process (Ra/Ac generator),the project could also slowly reduce obsolete radioactivematerial as well as produce Ac-225.
